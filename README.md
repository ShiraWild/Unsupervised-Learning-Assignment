**About the assignemnt**: The assignment focuses on unsupervised methods (K means) using PCA for Dimensionality Reduction and visualising the data. 
The goal is to apply k-means clustering in order to create clusters from the dataset - for fake and real news for given articles.
  
**About the data** - Fake.csv and True.csv - Contains list of articles considered as "fake" or "real" news. each record holds information on particular article.

**Main parts:**

1. Read CSV files and create one single dataframe **
2. Cluster the samples into two clusters - real and fake 
3. Apply PCA and visualize the clustering in 2D or 3D
4. Performance Evaluation - Accuracy 
5+6. Find optimal k - using Siloette and SSD scores according to different k values**
7. Apply PCA and K-means, Generate the features using tf-idf vectorizer
